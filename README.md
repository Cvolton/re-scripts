# re-scripts
Ghidra and IDA scripts that I use but that aren't polished enough for general usage. Sharing in hopes that someone will potentially find these useful and adapt these for their own usage. Made for reverse engineering the popular 2D platformer game: Geometry Dash.

If you intend on using these, make sure to look inside first, a lot of these have hardcoded filesystem paths and what not.

More polished scripts are moved to the [Geode Bindings repository](https://github.com/geode-sdk/bindings/tree/main/scripts/ghidra).
